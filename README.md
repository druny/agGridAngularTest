# Angular agGrid Component Assignment

## Goal 

The purpose of this exercise is to check the candidate’s ability to create a standalone Angular application with 3rd party library integration and customise the functionality through the 3rd party library API. 

## Acceptance criteria 

We expect the standalone Angular application with the requested features will be developed and shared through Github. The final result will be analysed with the following criteria in mind: 

- `Architecture and design.` We expect the candidate to make the decision on the necessary components architecture which follows Angular best practice recommendations. 
- `Code.` Clean and readable code style is important part of this exercise. Usage of TSlint (or similar) tool for code styling is expected. 
- `Unit testing.` The candidate should provide unit tests where appropriate. 
- `Attention to the details.` We expect that all features listed in the description section are delivered and any side effects are thought through and tested.   
- `Creativity and Research ability.` You are expected in relatively short period of time to research and use 3rd party API to customise the standard functionality in most efficient way. Nice styling is not required, but will be a bonus. 

## Assignment

You will be creating Angular application with a single component, which will use 3rd Party library called agGrid (https://www.ag-grid.com). 

There is an instruction on agGrid website on how to create Angular application using Angular CLI (https://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-angular-angularcli).
